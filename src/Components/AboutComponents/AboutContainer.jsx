                    Software Engineer with experience in Ruby on Rails and JavaScript frameworks and a background in Logistics Management and Transportation. Possess strong skills in project management, collaborative problem solving, multitasking and paying great attention to details.<br/><br/>
                    Programming was always something I was curious about but never got a chance to interact with it. While working at Whole Foods Market as a Dairy buyer, I've started to develop a greater interest in programming. I was interacting with technologies every day. As customers would call to know if a product was available I came to a realization that their website could be improved upon to show more details.<br/>
                    I decided to explore coding by teaching myself HTML & CSS and building a static website from bottom up. Full of enthusiasm, I decided to enroll in the Flatiron School Software Engineering Program to gain the necessary skills to become a Full Stack Web Developer. From the very first day of the program, I remember the feelings of joy and accomplishment of being able to produce lines of codes and was amazed by how powerful theses lines were.<br/>
                    I am ready to use my skills and technology to find solutions to real-world problems and building interactive, high-quality products that can improve the way people interact with information and one another around the globe. I am passionate and love to create software that delivers a deep and meaningful impact on people's lives.<br/><br/>
                    When I am not coding you can find me playing basketball, video games or at the dog park with my dog Shaq. Let's connect!<br/><br/>
